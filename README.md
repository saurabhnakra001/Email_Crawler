# Email_Crawler
This project focuses on making an Email Crawler which can be used for fetching emails and their attachments from a given mailing list available on an archive(for e.g.   http://mail-archives.apache.org/)

# Steps to use :

Mailing list is given
Access the archive store and get the information of how the emails are arranged
Depending on that make the folder structure locally
Download whatever is the unit of storage locally
Log the details for reference

# Inputs :

Link to the archive
Pattern of mails storage (working on it to auto figure out)
Output in which folder and what pattern

# Outputs :
Information of what done what not
Mails and their attachments in a certain format

# Possible errors :

Link to the archive is not able to connect
The pattern of mails storage does not apply to our assumption
No permission of making folder in local machine
Internet Connectivity is lost meanwhile fetching the details

# Functionalities :
Update current month mailing list
Should be able to log all types of errors
